# Falcon-Model-Customization-for-Department-Store-Product-Categorization
The objective of the project is to empower the Falcon model with the proficiency to accurately assign products to their respective departments, ultimately contributing to a more efficient and streamlined classification system within the context of department store retail.
The model learns patterns and features from labeled data, associating specific visual or textual characteristics with corresponding product categories. This approach aims to automate and improve the accuracy of organizing and sorting diverse products within a department store setting, enhancing efficiency and the user experience.
